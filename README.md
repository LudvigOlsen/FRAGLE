# Installation
- Requirement: you need to have "conda" available in your system
- Command for using "Fragle_Env.yml" file for installation:
    - conda env create -f Fragle_Env.yml
- Command for activating installed "Fragle" environment:
    - conda activate Fragle

# Running Fragle
- Clone the github repo and go inside the repo
- Install and activate "Fragle" environment
- Run the main.py file (you have to be inside the directory where you have kept all the Fragle files including the main.py file):
    - python main.py {input_path} {output_path}
    - {input_path} is the full path for the folder containing all of your .bam and .bai files (sample1.bam, sample1.bam.bai, sample2.bam, sample2.bam.bai, ...) -> all bam files need to be mapped to hg19 or GRCh37 reference genome
    - {output_path} is the full path for the folder where you want the Fragle predictions to be in -> look for a file named "Predictions.csv", it will contain all the Fragle predictions

# Additional Information
- You will see the following additional files created in the specified {output_path} after running Fragle:
    - high_data.pkl: feature generated from the input bam files for HT model
    - low_data.pkl: feature generated from the input bam files for LT model 
    - high_predictions.csv: predictions obtained from Fragle HT model
    - low_predictions.csv: predictions obtained from Fragle LT model
    - Predictions.csv: final output predictions generated by Fragle
